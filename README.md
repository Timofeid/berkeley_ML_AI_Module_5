# Notebook Summary

This Jupyter Notebook explores the acceptance rates of different types of coupons, focusing on bar and coffee house coupons. The notebook follows a step-by-step analysis, highlighting key findings and providing recommendations for further investigation.

## Main Steps

1. Data Preparation:
   - Import the necessary libraries.
   - Load the dataset.
   - Explore the dataset structure and contents.

2. Bar Coupons Investigation:
   - Analyze the acceptance rates for different groups based on various criteria.
   - Visualize the acceptance rates using bar plots.
   - Compare acceptance rates between different driver groups.
   - Hypothesize about drivers who accepted bar coupons.

3. Coffee House Coupons Investigation:
   - Calculate the overall acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.
   - Explore correlations between different features using a pair plot.
   - Analyze acceptance rates for different groups based on numerical and categorical features.
   - Focus on specific categories with higher acceptance rates.
   - Investigate occupation-specific acceptance rates.
   - Identify a focus group based on occupation, visit frequency, and coupon time.
   - Calculate acceptance rates for the focus group.

## Findings

1. Bar Coupons:
   - Drivers who go to bars 4-8 times per month have the highest acceptance rate.
   - Other criteria, such as age, passenger type, and occupation, have a moderate impact on acceptance rates.
   - Further investigation is recommended, including scatter plots with weather, income, destination, time of day, and geolocation.

2. Coffee House Coupons:
   - The overall acceptance rate for coffee house coupons is low.
   - Higher acceptance rates are observed for higher temperatures, longer expiration times, younger audiences, and closer geolocations.
   - Specific categories, such as non-urgent destination, driving with a friend or partner, and coupon time between 10am and 2pm, show higher acceptance rates.
   - Occupation-specific analysis reveals occupations with acceptance rates above 60%.
   - A focus group is identified based on occupation, visit frequency, and coupon time.

## Next Steps

1. Bar Coupons:
   - Build scatter plots to investigate the impact of weather, income, destination, time of day, and geolocation on acceptance rates.
   - Explore other potential factors that may influence acceptance rates.

2. Coffee House Coupons:
   - Further investigate the impact of occupation on acceptance rates.
   - Analyze other categorical features to identify additional focus groups.
   - Conduct A/B testing to validate the findings and recommendations.

## Recommendations

1. Bar Coupons:
   - Focus on drivers who go to bars 4-8 times per month, as they have the highest acceptance rate.
   - Consider targeting specific age groups, passenger types, and occupations to increase acceptance rates.
   - Conduct further analysis to identify additional factors that may impact acceptance rates.

2. Coffee House Coupons:
   - Target customers who visit coffee houses more than once per month and prefer coupon times between 10am and 2pm.
   - Explore occupation-specific campaigns to increase acceptance rates.
   - Conduct A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of different strategies.

Note: The recommendations provided are based on the analysis conducted in this notebook. Further analysis and testing are recommended to validate the findings and optimize coupon targeting strategies.
